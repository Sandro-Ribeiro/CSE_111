# Example 2
"""
A simple value is a value that doesnâ€™t contain parts, such as an integer. 
A compound value is a value that has parts, such as a list. Example 2 shows 
a students dictionary where each value is a Python list. Because each list 
contains multiple parts, we say that the dictionary stores compound values.
