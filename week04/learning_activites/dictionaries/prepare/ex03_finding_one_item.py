# Example 3
"""
The reason Python dictionaries were developed is to make finding items 
easy and fast. As explained in example 1, to find an item in a dictionary, 
a programmer needs to write just one line of code that follows this template:
value = dictionary_name[key]. That one line of code will cause the computer 
to search the dictionary until it finds the key. Then the computer will return 
the value that corresponds to the key. Some programmers forget how easy it is 
to find items in a dictionary, and when asked to write code to find an item, 
they write complex code like lines 32â€“35 in this example.
