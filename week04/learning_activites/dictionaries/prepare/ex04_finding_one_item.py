# Example 4
"""
Clearly, writing one line of code is easier for a programmer than writing the 
for loop. Not only is the one line of code easier to write, but the computer 
will execute it much, much faster than the for loop. Therefore, when you need 
to write code to find an item in a dictionary, donâ€™t write a loop. Instead, 
write one line of code that uses the square brackets ([ and ]) and a key to 
find an item. This example shows the correct way to find an item in a dictionary.
