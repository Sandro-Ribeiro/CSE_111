# Example 9
"""
Example 9 shows how to process all elements in a compound list. 
The for loop at line 29 causes the computer to repeat lines 30â€“36 
once for each inner list that is inside the compound list named 
apple_tree_data. Line 32 retrieves the fruit amount from one 
inner list and then line 36 adds one fruit amount to the total 
fruit amount.
