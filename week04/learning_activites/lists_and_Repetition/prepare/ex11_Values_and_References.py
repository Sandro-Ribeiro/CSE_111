Why does it appear that appending the number 5 onto lx 
also appends the number 5 onto lyâ€‰? Because lx and ly 
refer to the same list. There is really only one list 
with two references to that list. Because lx and ly 
refer to the same list, a change to the list through 
variable lx can be seen through variable ly.
