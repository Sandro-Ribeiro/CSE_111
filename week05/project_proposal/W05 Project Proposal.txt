Program Title

	File Organizer Program

Program Description

	The program reorganizes and renames files in a specified folder 
	based on user-defined criteria. The application is useful for 
	organizing large volumes of files, using metadata and other 
	information to categorize and rename files efficiently.

Learning objectives

1.	File and directory manipulation in Python.
2.	Extracting and using file metadata.
3.	Using Python modules such as os and shutil.

Modules Used

1.	os: For file and directory manipulation.
2.	shutil: For advanced file and directory operations.
3.	datetime: For date and time manipulation.
4.	unittest: For creating and running automated tests.

Functions

1.	list_files(directory): Lists all files in a specified directory.
2.	get_metadata(file): Gets the metadata of a file.
3.	rename_file(file, new_name): Renames a file to the specified new name.
4.	reorganize_files(directory, criteria): Reorganizes files in a directory 
	based on specified criteria (e.g., creation date).

Test Functions
1.	test_list_files(): Tests the file listing function.
2.	test_get_metadata(): Tests the metadata retrieval function.
3.	test_rename_file(): Tests the file renaming function.
4.	test_reorganize_files(): Tests the file reorganization function
