# Example 5
"""
In Python, lists are objects with attributes and methods, 
and a programmer can modify a list by calling those methods.

Example below contains a program that is similar to example 2 
in the preparation content 1 of Week 4. Now that you know what 
an object is, that objects have methods, and that Python lists 
are objects, this example code should make more sense than it 
did in week 4. Notice that the append method is called on lines 
19â€“21, insert is called on line 10, index is called on line 29 
pop is called on line 36, and remove is called on line 39.
