Python dictionaries are objects with attributes and methods, 
and a programmer can modify a dictionary by calling those 
methods. There doesnâ€™t seem to be an official Python web page 
that documents the dictionary methods, so here is a list of 
the built-in dictionary methods:

d.clear()	    Removes all the elements from the dictionary d.

d.copy()	    Returns a copy of the dictionary d.

d.get(key)	    Returns the value of the specified key. Calling 
                the get method is almost equivalent to using 
                square brackets ([ and ]) to find a key in a 
                dictionary.

d.items()	    Returns a list that contains the key value pairs 
                that are in the dictionary d.

d.keys()	    Returns a list that contains the keys that are in 
                the dictionary d.

d.pop(key)	    Removes the element with the specified key from 
                the dictionary d.

d.update(other)	Updates the dictionary d with the key value pairs 
                that are in the other dictionary.

d.values()	    Returns a list that contains the values that are 
                in the dictionary d.

The following example code, which is similar to example 1 from the 
preparation content 2 of week 4, calls dictionary methods at lines 
53, 59, and 67.
